# Supermarket_SystemBilling
This is my first project in c++.
This system allows administrators to add, update, and delete products, while buyers can purchase items and receive a detailed receipt.
 Features & Technologies Used:
âœ… Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles like encapsulation & abstraction
âœ… File handling to store and manage product data
âœ… Admin authentication for secure access
âœ… User-friendly menu system for easy navigation

ðŸ’¡ Through this project, I strengthened my skills in C++ file handling, data structures, and OOP design.
